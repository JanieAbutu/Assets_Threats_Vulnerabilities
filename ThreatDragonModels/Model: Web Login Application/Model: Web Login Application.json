    "description": "The system modeled is a Web Login Application that allows users to authenticate themselves to access a service. The login page consists of a web form where the user enters a username and password. These credentials are transmitted to an authentication server, which validates them against a hashed password database. Upon successful authentication, the system creates a session token and grants the user access to protected resources.\n\nThe overall architecture includes a web client (browser), a web server hosting the login page and handling HTTP(S) requests, an authentication server performing credential verification, a database server storing hashed passwords and user details.",
